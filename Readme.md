# Survey form

## HTML

I have written the html code required to display the form and used Bootstrap to align the elements 

## CSS 

I wrote the necessary stylings for the form and used media query to make it responsive. I could have done it using Bootsrap since I am at  the beginning stage handling the bootstrap felt like complex. Soon I will learn to use it more to handle it

## JS

I have written the script for the star rating so it will dynamically change the color based on the rating.
